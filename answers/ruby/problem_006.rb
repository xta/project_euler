# Sum square difference

## The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
  ## 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

## The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
  ## (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

## Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

## Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

range = (1..100).to_a

sum_of_squares = range.map { |n| n**2}.reduce(&:+) #=> 338_350

sum = range.reduce(&:+)
square_of_sum = sum**2

difference = square_of_sum - sum_of_squares # 25164150
